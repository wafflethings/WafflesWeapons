I'm not old enough to get a job, so it's not like I can earn it myself.
You'll also get early access to updates.

## Installation

If using [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/Waff1e/WafflesWeapons), you can install it using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). 

Otherwise, download the .zip, and extract it to `ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\plugins`.
If you aren't using r2mm, you will also seperately have to install [AtlasLib](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/Waff1e/AtlasLib).

## Weapons

### Revolvers
- [Fan Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT91uk5Mbqg): shoots powerful shots, charged by shooting enemies with any revolver. Coins have a unique behaviour. The alt shoots slower, but speeds up when you press Left Click.

- [Malevolent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry_1gfVrn-E): three rapid shots, and a diet malicious railcannon. Explosions pierce with the alt.

- [Desperado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiyRmELVCvY): when you shoot at the right timing, releases a beam that bounces between enemies. The alt is more generous, but weaker.

- [Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo4XB46rF74): shoots a black hole that deals large amounts of damage, pulling in enemies when it is shot. It absorbs magnets, rockets, and more.

### Nailguns

- [Mindrender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m13hpRKb1g): shoots nails in bursts, charging up a mindflayer beam on hit. The alt releases homing orbs.

### Rocket Launchers
- [E.P. Charger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazqWG20eVg): alt fire releases a powerful homing rocket, which needs to be charged up by hitting enemies with RLs. It pierces enemies, and does not get destroyed until it hits a wall or floor.

### Arms
- [Earthshatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7XYmoIZfE): hold F to charge, and release to launch yourself. Hurts enemies on contact, and can parry coins.
